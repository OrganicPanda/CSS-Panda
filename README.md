CSS-Panda
=========

This is a *totally* worthwhile attempt at my OrganicPanda logo using only completely un-semantic divs and CSS trickery. Degrades to an unexpectedly pleasant robot-style panda for any browsers that do not support the CSS used (Transforms, Border Radius etc...).

The pre-built CSS can be found in the *build* directly or, if you want to modify the SASS (The only sane way to modify this thing), can be be built as follows:
